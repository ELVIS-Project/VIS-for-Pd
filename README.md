# VIS for Pd
VIS for Pd is a dataflow programming extension for the VIS-Framework, based on PureData (Pd).
Requirements:
- Miller Puckette's [Pd-0.46-7](http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html]).
- For the time being: Thomas Grill's [py/pyext](https://github.com/grrrr/py) (the py.pd_darwin binary is included in the _lib_ folder, and only works for some OSX systems at this moment. Compiling your own binary is necessary).
- Python, and the following modules:
  - [music21](https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21).
  - [VIS-Framework](https://github.com/ELVIS-Project/vis-framework).
