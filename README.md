# VIS for Pd
VIS for Pd is a dataflow programming extension for the VIS-Framework, based on PureData (Pd).

####Requirements:
- Miller Puckette's [Pd-0.46-7](http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html]).
- Thomas Grill's [py/pyext](https://github.com/grrrr/py). Follow the instructions on Grill's [GitHub](https://github.com/grrrr/py) page, including where to add the resulting binary into the Pd environment later. As a courtesy the py external binaries for Pd (Windows, Linux, and OSX) have bin included in the /lib/pre-compiled-externals folder. Use at your own risk, they may or may not work. 
- Python, and the following modules:
  - Michael Cuthbert's [music21](https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21).
  - McGill's [VIS-Framework](https://github.com/ELVIS-Project/vis-framework) developed by the [SIMSSA](https://simssa.ca) project.
  - The open source [pandas](https://github.com/pydata/pandas) library.
